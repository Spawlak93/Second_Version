      <h2>Simon Pawlak</h2>
      <p>He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away! We need a hang glider, and a crotch less uncle sam costume, and I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked red heads, and I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father. Aww, gee, you got me there, Rick. Yea and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mothers ovaries!

Hey, what the fuck, Morty? The train you got me just completely derailed itself. There's blood all over the windows. What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. Return it? Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty! Consume, Morty! Nobody's out there shopping with this fucking virus! Morty! The principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way!

Please god, oh lord, hear my prayers…! YES! Fuck you god, not today bitch! Must… continue… moving… in… ways… that… lead… to… dying… with… you. My name is Slip- Slippery Stair. I'll take ya down there for 25 shmeckels! Summer, next time we're hiding in a chlorkian echo nest, can you do me a favour and turn your ringer off?!

That's Right Morty! This is gonna be a lot like that. Except you know. It's gonna make sense. God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me. Dont mind those stare goblins. Nice to wheat you!
